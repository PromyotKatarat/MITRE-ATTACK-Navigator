Covers techniques used in attacks involving malware (e.g., Ploutus, Jackpot) and hardware (e.g., Black Box, SIM Card cable). Focuses on 2025 Thailand incident involving Bulgarian suspect 'Ivan' using 'Jackpot' malware and SIM Card cable to disrupt internet signals and control ATMs ([Web:2], [X:0]), and US incidents in 2024 ([Web:13], [Web:22]). All techniques are sourced from referenced incidents or general ATM Jackpotting reports ([Web:6], [Web:7], [Web:15]).",
